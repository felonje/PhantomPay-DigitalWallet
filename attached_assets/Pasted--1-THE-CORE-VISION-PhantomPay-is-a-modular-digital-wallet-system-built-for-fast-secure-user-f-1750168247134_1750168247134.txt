💎 1️⃣ THE CORE VISION
PhantomPay is a modular digital wallet system built for fast, secure, user-first financial transactions.
It's designed to handle both traditional money (mobile money, fiat) and future extensions (crypto, tokens, loyalty points, airtime, data bundles).

You’re building something:

For real-world transactions (Kenya, Africa, global)

With next-gen features that competitors don’t fully offer

Using modular tech that allows you to expand fast
